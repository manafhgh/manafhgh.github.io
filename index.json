IP geolocation systems need to identify such changes to provide accurate results for location-dependent applications such as geo-blocking and online fraud prevention. We propose an efficient method to identify IP blocks that move, since full geolocation is expensive and unnecessary for blocks that do not move. Our approach uses persistent changes in latency as an indicator of block movement, tracking all ping-responsive IPv4 /24 blocks from a handful of globally distributed vantage points. We estimate around 2.1% of the 3.77M /24 blocks we studied have changed location at least once in the last 3 months of 2018. We find that the remaining blocks were consistently RTT-stable during the same period, suggesting that their locations were also stable. We validate a random sample of blocks we identify as moving and confirm 80% (41 of 51) through traceroutes.","tags":[],"title":"Delay-Based Identification of Internet Block Movement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert McAndrew","Manaf Gharaibeh","Haonan Wangz","Stephen Hayne","Christos Papadopoulos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1511161200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579066535,"objectID":"7b002dd24b4147389bf7656fc788b314","permalink":"https://manafhgh.github.io/publication/a-functional-approach-to-scanner-detection/","publishdate":"2017-11-20T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/a-functional-approach-to-scanner-detection/","section":"publication","summary":"Detecting scanning in Internet traffic is a well-studied topic with no single, definitive approach. Among the proposed methods are two which are widely accepted, but with known limitations: one based on a static fanout ratio, and another on principal component analysis (PCA). We introduce a two-step procedure based on Functional PCA and k-means clustering which we argue provides significantly better robustness and data-driven applicability. We validate and compare using synthetic datasets with ''ground truth'' about anomalies on FTP and HTTP port traffic flows; our method identifies all scanners. We also compare approaches using NTP flow data prior to a reflective DDoS attack in 2014, providing a real-world example to illustrate the deficiencies of existing approaches and how they are addressed by our functional framework procedure. Lastly, we discuss insights into the traffic that cannot be obtained by the previous methods.","tags":[],"title":"A Functional Approach to Scanner Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manaf Gharaibeh","Anant Shah","Bradley Huffaker","Han Zhang","Roya Ensafi","Christos Papadopoulos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506837600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579066535,"objectID":"4f827f68ae2175a1719d94fd956ff1aa","permalink":"https://manafhgh.github.io/publication/a-look-at-router-geolocation-in-public-and-commercial-databases/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/a-look-at-router-geolocation-in-public-and-commercial-databases/","section":"publication","summary":"Internet measurement research frequently needs to map infrastructure components, such as routers, to their physical locations. Although public and commercial geolocation services are often used for this purpose, their accuracy when applied to network infrastructure has not been sufficiently assessed. Prior work focused on evaluating the overall accuracy of geolocation databases, which is dominated by their performance on end-user IP addresses. In this work, we evaluate the reliability of router geolocation in databases. We use a dataset of about 1.64M router interface IP addresses extracted from the CAIDA Ark dataset to examine the country- and city-level coverage and consistency of popular public and commercial geolocation databases. We also create and provide a ground-truth dataset of 16,586 router interface IP addresses and their city-level locations, and use it to evaluate the databases' accuracy with a regional breakdown analysis. Our results show that the databases are not reliable for geolocating routers and that there is room to improve their country- and city-level accuracy. Based on our results, we present a set of recommendations to researchers concerning the use of geolocation databases to geolocate routers.","tags":[],"title":"A Look at Router Geolocation in Public and Commercial Databases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manaf Gharaibeh","Han Zhang","Christos Papadopoulos","John Heidemann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1460268000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586335795,"objectID":"bc84aaf86f78b84c4c6110c642ab181e","permalink":"https://manafhgh.github.io/publication/assessing-co-locality-of-ip-blocks/","publishdate":"2016-04-10T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/assessing-co-locality-of-ip-blocks/","section":"publication","summary":"Many IP Geolocation services and applications assume that all IP addresses within the same /24 IPv4 prefix (a /24 block) reside in close physical proximity. For blocks that contain addresses in very different locations (such as blocks identifying network backbones), this assumption can result in a large geolocation error. In this paper we evaluate the co-location assumption. We first develop and validate a hierarchical clustering method to find clusters of IP addresses with similar observed delay measurements within /24 blocks. We validate our methodology against two ground-truth datasets, confirming that 93% of the identified multi-cluster blocks are true positives with multiple physical locations and an upper bound for false positives of only about 5.4%. We then apply our methodology to a large dataset of 1.41M /24 blocks extracted from a delay-measurement study of the entire responsive IPv4 address space. We find that about 247K (17%) out of 1.41M blocks are not co-located, thus quantifying the error in the /24 block co-location assumption.","tags":[],"title":"Assessing Co-Locality of IP Blocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Han Zhang","Manaf Gharaibeh","Spiros Thanasoulas","Christos Papadopoulos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1460008800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579066535,"objectID":"36ddf999f246852696a83c41730b179a","permalink":"https://manafhgh.github.io/publication/botdigger-detecting-dga-bots-in-a-single-network/","publishdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/botdigger-detecting-dga-bots-in-a-single-network/","section":"publication","summary":"To improve the resiliency of communication between bots and C\u0026C servers, bot masters began utilizing Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) in recent years. Many systems have been introduced to detect DGA-based botnets. However, they suffer from several limitations, such as requiring DNS traffic collected across many networks, the presence of multiple bots from the same botnet, and so forth. These limitations make it very hard to detect individual bots when using traffic collected from a single network. In this paper, we introduce BotDigger, a system that detects DGA-based bots using DNS traffic without a priori knowledge of the domain generation algorithm. BotDigger utilizes a chain of evidence, including quantity, temporal and linguistic evidence to detect an individual bot by only monitoring traffic at the DNS servers of a single network. We evaluate BotDigger’s performance using traces from two DGA-based botnets: Kraken and Conflicker. Our results show that BotDigger detects all the Kraken bots and 99.8% of Conficker bots. A one-week DNS trace captured from our university and three traces collected from our research lab are used to evaluate false positives. The results show that the false positive rates are 0.05% and 0.39% for these two groups of background traces, respectively.","tags":[],"title":"BotDigger: Detecting DGA Bots in a Single Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jakub Czyz","Michael Kallitsis","Manaf Gharaibeh","Christos Papadopoulos","Michael Bailey","Manish Karir"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1415170800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579066535,"objectID":"28ee3c4e504329b4f072dd8776eec9b9","permalink":"https://manafhgh.github.io/publication/the-rise-and-decline-of-ntp-ddos-attacks/","publishdate":"2014-11-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/the-rise-and-decline-of-ntp-ddos-attacks/","section":"publication","summary":"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks based on Network Time Protocol (NTP) amplification, which became prominent in December 2013, have received significant global attention. We chronicle how this attack rapidly rose from obscurity to become the dominant large DDoS vector. Via the lens of five distinct datasets, we characterize the advent and evolution of these attacks. Through a dataset that measures a large fraction of global Internet traffic, we show a three order of magnitude rise in NTP. Using a large darknet, we observe a similar rise in global scanning activity, both malicious and research. We then dissect an active probing dataset, which reveals that the pool of amplifiers totaled 2.2M unique IPs and includes a small number of ''mega amplifiers,'' servers that replied to a single tiny probe packet with gigabytes of data. This dataset also allows us, for the first time, to analyze global DDoS attack victims (including ports attacked) and incidents, where we show 437K unique IPs targeted with at least 3 trillion packets, totaling more than a petabyte. Finally, ISP datasets shed light on the local impact of these attacks. In aggregate, we show the magnitude of this major Internet threat, the community's response, and the effect of that response.","tags":[],"title":"Taming the 800 Pound Gorilla: The Rise and Decline of NTP DDoS Attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Riyad Al-Shalabi","Ghassan Kanaan","Manaf Gharaibeh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1144303200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579066535,"objectID":"e726cea063b221d6c0b035e366e0ec47","permalink":"https://manafhgh.github.io/publication/arabic-text-categorization-using-knn-algorithm/","publishdate":"2006-04-06T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/arabic-text-categorization-using-knn-algorithm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Arabic Text Categorization Using KNN Algorithm","type":"publication"}]
